XLA service API.

Users 1) build up computations and 2) create allocations via this API.
Computations are composed of data flowing between arbitrarily-sized
vector-oriented operations.

Users build up computations using a ComputationHandle, and talk about
allocations using GlobalDataHandles.

There are currently no checkpointing capabilities or distribution/replication
guarantees. The service runs on a single machine (e.g. one task) and that is
its failure domain.

Canonical example of "alpha * X + Y":
* Make a computation.
* Add alpha and X and Y as parameters.
* Request the multiplication of alpha and X.
* Request the addition of that result and Y.

Then, pass the computation and appropriately shaped inputs to the XLA
service's Execute method, which provides a result as a GlobalDataHandle.

All data in XLA computations are conceptually immutable.

Note: this API is subject to change / refinement over time -- use the
provided client libraries to insulate code from changes to this service API.
